We hope you enjoy and we look forward to your contributions!

## Start up the server
All of the data is stored in the db.json file. You'll access this data using a JSON server. Install json-server globally by running this command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

Then, run the below in the terminal to start the server:

```bash
npm run server 
```

This will run your backend on port 6001

or

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 6001
```

In a new terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```
